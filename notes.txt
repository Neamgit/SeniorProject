                  Models
------------------------------------------------

Issue model: This model would represent the issues being voted on in the election,
     and would typically include fields such as
      title, description, and potential outcomes.

Ballot model: This model would represent the ballots used in the election, 
        and would typically include fields such as 
        election ID, ballot type, and list of candidates or issues.

Election model: This model would represent the elections being held on the website,
            and would typically include fields such as
             title, date, location, and description.

Result model: This model would represent the results of the election,
 and would typically include fields such as 
 candidate or issue ID, vote count, and percentage of votes.

When a voter casts their vote, they are likely to select a candidate from a list of
 candidates running in their constituency. 
 ===This means that the Candidate model would need to have a field for the constituency 
 they are running in, which would be used to filter the list of candidates presented
  to the voter.

When a candidate is registered, their details (such as name, political party, and constituency)
 would need to be displayed on the website for voters to see. 
 ====This means that the Voter model would need to have a way to retrieve the list of
  candidates running in the voter's constituency, so that this information can be 
  displayed to them.

In some cases, a voter may need to verify their identity before casting their vote.
 This could be done by checking the voter's identification number against the voter database.
 ====== This means that the Voter model would need to have a field for the identification number
 , which could be used to verify the voter's identity. 
The Candidate model, on the other hand, would not need this field.

Ballot Controller
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
createBallot: This function would handle the creation of a new ballot for an election. 
              It would take in the required information for a ballot 
              (such as election ID, ballot type, and list of candidates/issues) 
              and create a new Ballot document in the database.

getBallot: This function would retrieve a specific ballot from the database, given its ID. 
              It could be used to display the details of a ballot to a voter before they
               cast their vote.

castVote: This function would handle the submission of a vote by a voter.
               It would take in the voter's ID, the ballot ID, 
               and the ID of the candidate/issue they are voting for, 
               and update the corresponding Result document in the database with 
               the new vote count and percentage.

getResults: This function would retrieve the results of an election, given its ID. 
              It would query the Result collection to calculate the vote count
               and percentage for each candidate/issue, and return an array of 
               objects containing this information.

getWinners: This function would retrieve the winner(s) of an election, given its ID.
               It would use the getResults function to calculate the vote count and percentage
                for each candidate/issue,
                 and return an array of objects containing the winning candidate(s)/issue(s) 
                 and their vote counts.

function that may add in election controller
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getElectionResults: This function would retrieve the results of an election, given its ID. 
                    It would use the Result model to calculate the vote count and 
                    percentage for each candidate/issue, and return an array of 
                    objects containing this information.

getElectionWinners: This function would retrieve the winner(s) of an election, given its ID. 
                    It would use the getElectionResults function to calculate the vote count 
                    and percentage for each candidate/issue, and return an array of 
                    objects containing the winning candidate(s)/issue(s) and their vote counts.

getVoterBallots: This function would retrieve a list of ballots that a specific voter
                   is eligible to vote on, given their ID and the election ID.
                    It would use the Voter and Ballot models to determine which ballots
                     the voter is eligible to vote on, and return an array of objects 
                     containing the details of each ballot.
